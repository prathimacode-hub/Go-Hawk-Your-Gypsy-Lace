## Challenges We ran into 😱
Being a beginner in web development, it was a challenge to complete a full stack work and bring this webapp live. As we had none of designers or full stack developers in a team. Just being 2 of us, and adding up all the administrative features and providing user recommendations according to the users choice of places was a bulgy task.😢Doing all this in a weekend was challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 😎
We are proud of what we had done. We did not know we could bring this on to the table with very less time on hands after teammates had left us into doom.

## What we learned👨🏻‍🎓
Travel is something i adore a lot. The main reason to join this hackathon, to learning an abundant stack of knowledge be it advanced python, using html, css and javascript. To bring in maps, adding up google api's and place id's and what not, I didn't know these all even exist to make websites work.

## What's next for Go Hawk Your Gypsy Lace💦
